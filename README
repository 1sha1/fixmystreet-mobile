FixMyStreet Mobile App
----------------------

This is the FixMyStreet mobile app for reporting problems to an instance of the
FixMyStreet platform - https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet.

It's still in development at the moment.

The FixMyStreet mobile app uses PhoneGap and has versions for Android and iOS.

Running
-------

To get it up and running you will need to create a config.js file in www/js/ based
on the www/js/config-example.js file. This has configuration for which FMS instance
to use etc.

You should then be able to build and run it like any other PhoneGap project.

The app works out which version of the PhoneGap JavaScript file to use and loads
it dynamically - see www/cordova-independant.js for details.
