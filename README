FixMyStreet Mobile App
----------------------

This is the FixMyStreet mobile app for reporting problems to an instance of the
FixMyStreet platform - https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet.

It's still in development at the moment.

The FixMyStreet mobile app uses PhoneGap and has versions for Android and iOS.

Running
-------

To get it up and running you will need to create a config.js file in src/js/ based
on the src/js/config-example.js file. This has configuration for which FMS instance
to use etc.

You should then be able to build and run it like any other PhoneGap project.

The platform specific cordova.js files are inside the projects and then the src directory
is included inside the www folders for each platform. On Android this is done with a 
symbolic link, on iOS by a build script.
